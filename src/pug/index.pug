                    h3 Summary
                    p I'm a developer and designer working on enterprise applications and services. Most of the time you'll find me getting my hands dirty with the code of student and faculty and staff facing applications and data solutions at Georgia State University. As a Lead Application Developer I've worked with a myriad of modern and legacy infrastructure, architecture, code frameworks, and languages. I've dabbled in database administration using Oracle tools; analyzed reams of data to hone in on systemic bugs; trained, advised, and supervised junior employees to catch them up to speed; constructed admin dashboards and student leaderboards to oversee and foster student populations and growth; abstracted, integrated, and automated with CRUD, ETL, SPAS, AWS and other TLAs. I'm a certified cloud practitioner. I'm a board member at a makerspace, bringing cost-effective serverless automations to a non-profit space. And I make time left over for life outside of work.
